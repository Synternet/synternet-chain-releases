  "details": "This is v0.24 software upgrade for the Synternet Protocol Testnet.\n\nIf upgrade proposal passed, it would commit the Synternet Protocol Chain to halting the Synternet Chain application binary at block height 8883484 (approximately 14:00 UTC on June 12th 2025) and starting the new Synternet Chain application binary. Synternet Chain node operators must have already prepared the correct binary before the Synternet Chain halts and be ready to launch it after the Synternet Chain halts. For more information on deploying and managing validator binaries: https://docs.synternet.com/docs/for-validators/Mainnet/becoming-a-validator.\n\nThis upgrade proposal adds a few key improvements:\n- Functionality to burn coins.\n- Pricing supports pay-per-message.",
