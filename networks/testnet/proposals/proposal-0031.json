Synternet Chain node operators must have already prepared the correct binary before the Synternet Chain halts and be ready to launch it after the Synternet Chain halts. For more information on deploying and managing validator binaries: https://docs.synternet.com/docs/for-validators/Mainnet/becoming-a-validator.\n\nThis upgrade proposal adds a few key improvements:\n- Critical fix for Burn functionality.\n- Multisig and Ledger support for Burn message.",
